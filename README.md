3. Create three test classes as required
4. You may use any number and form of commits and branches for this assignment
5. Push your entire project including both the IUT and test Java files to GitHub. Make sure the package structure is as instructed, where "numbers" is the top package containing the unchanged ArmstrongNumbers.java file, and "test" as its sub-package containing the source test files.
